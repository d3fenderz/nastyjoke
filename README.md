## Read the code

Don't run these scripts blindly. Read the code before executing them.

## How to use

Using a virtual machine is strongly recommended. Once it's installed, make a snapshot.

This way, you can restore it quickly, just in case things turn bad.

Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/jmau111-org/nastyjoke /dev/shm/nastyjoke
cd /dev/shm/nastyjoke/scripts
```

You can run these scripts on the targeted machine with `bash script`, or `./script` if it's already executable.

To ensure the file is executable, you can type `chmod +x script`.
